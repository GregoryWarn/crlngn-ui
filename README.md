## Carolingian UI
A light module that provides a sleek minimalist UI overhaul, focusing on saving space on screen and improving overall look and feel of Foundry VTT v12. Most changes are made through CSS styling and should work with the majority of other modules, unless they specifically modify the UI.Â 

**Carolingian UI** is free to use and distribute under MIT License. If you reuse my code, please add mention to the original repo. 

### FEATURES:
- **Custom Fonts** for UI and journal;
- **Compact left controls:** small or regular sized icons; secondary bars can be hidden until an item is hovered or clicked; 
- **Secondary controls bar** has different styles to make it clearer;
- **Top Navigation** can be horizontally scrolled; player and GM markers are simple lines with the color of each player;
- **Compact Player List**, can be auto-hidden and opened on hover;
- **Macro hotbar** with optional resizing and styles;
- **Floating camera dock** - drag, resize and position anywhere on screen;
- **Right panel** buttons, sliders and headers have modified dark styles for a more uniform feel;
- **Settings** allow you to configure macro bar, left controls, camera dock and scene navigation;
- **Dark style for chat messages** if the selected Foundry theme is Dark (tested on DnD5e 4.x, partial support for other systems); 
- **Compact chat messages** (DnD5e) compact usage buttons to save some space on chat log;

### VERIFIED MODULE COMPATIBILITY (A-Z):
**Note:** This is not an extensive list - I've only included modules that I personally checked and which might be particularly affected by changes in the UI.
- Are You Focused? 1.2.x
- Break Time 12.0.x
- Carousel Combat Tracker 3.1.x
- Compact Scene Navigation 1.0.x (avoid using auto hide setting in both modules)
- Dice Tray 2.2.x
- Dungeon Draw 3.0.x
- Epic Rolls 5e 4.2.x
- Force Client Settings 2.5.x
- Hide Player UI 1.7.x
- LiveKit AV Client 0.5.x

- Taskbar 4.1.x
- Tidy 5e 9.1.x
- TheRipper93's Module Hub 4.1.x
- Touch VTT 2.2.x

I have also verified PF2e HUD, but I do not play PF2e so there might be issues I haven't noticed.


### IMPORTANT:
- The module was tested mostly on Foundry v12 and DnD 4.x. The overall UI styles are system agnostic, but chat card styles are mostly for DnD5e - I've done some basic tests for PF2e. If you would like to request support for a different system (and help with info and screenshots), please add a feature request on Github issue tracker (subject to evaluation);
- The module is currently compatible with **"Compact Scene Navigation"**, but you might want to disable the auto-hide setting on that module as my module also implements auto-hide; 
- Feel free to report compatibility status with other modules (subject to evaluation);
- If you use a non-compatible module, play with the settings and disable the parts that might be affecting it. 

### BUGS AND FEATURE REQUESTS:
- Please use the issue tracker to report any bugs and requests for enhancements using the appropriate labels.
- When reporting bugs, please first try to disable all other modules. Take screenshots of any errors and provide as much information as possible on your issue (Foundry version, game system, active modules).
