**Latest Version:** 1.0.2

**Compatibility:** 
- Foundry VTT version 12.328+

## Carolingian UI
A light module that provides a sleek minimalist UI overhaul, focusing on saving space on screen and improving overall look and feel of Foundry VTT v12.

**Carolingian UI** is free to use and distribute. If you reuse my code, please add mention to the original repo. 

### FEATURES:
- Chat messages for DnD5e 4.x have more compact usage buttons for saving some space;
- Chat messages are shown in dark mode if the selected Foundry theme is Dark (only tested for DnD5e);
- Compact left bar: the icons are brought together and the secondary bars are hidden until an item is hovered / clicked;
- Secondary controls bar has a different color to make it more clear;
- Top Navigation has a horizontal scroll option; the player and GM markers are made into simple lines with the color of each player
- Right panel buttons, sliders and headers had modified styles for a more uniform feel;
- Compact Player list - it opens on hover
- Reduced size of macro bar

### IMPORTANT:
- The module was tested on Foundry v12 and DnD 4.x. It might work on other game systems or other versions of DnD5e, but I have not tested them;
- The module is currently compatible with **"Compact Scene Navigation"**, but you might want to disable the auto-hide setting on that module as my module also implements auto-hide;
- Feel free to report compatibility status with other modules, but no guarantees that I will make this module compatible;

### BUGS AND FEATURE REQUESTS:
- Please use the issue tracker to report any bugs and requests for enhancements using the appropriate labels.
- When reporting bugs, please first disable all other modules (unless it's a compatibility issue with a specific module). Take screenshots of any errors and provide as much information as possible on your issue.
