This way, you can go back and forth between subfolders without reopening the folder list.</li>\n <li>Some users did not understand that 'Favorites' was Foundry's default navigation. I changed back the naming and icon to avoid confusion.</li>\n   <li>Retained folder list open/closed state in a same session (resets on reload)</li>\n</ul> <p><b>Keep the feedback coming!
